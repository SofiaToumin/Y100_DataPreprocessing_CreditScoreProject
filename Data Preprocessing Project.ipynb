    "We see that personal property has the lowest default rate - 6.91% because it's very important and people do find way to repay money on time so that they have a place to live. Real property purpose has pretty low default rate (7.57%) which makes sence since it it commercial purpose. Wedding has a 8% default rate - i guess newly married couple gets some money as presents so it's easier to return. As for getting a car or an education - default rates are pretty much the same - 9.33% and 9.22% - i guess that not 100% of students finish their education and can repay sucessfully and as for car purpose - people who need loan to buy a car don't usually have a lot of money, other way they would just buy it, so chance that they won't pay on time is pretty high.

I didn't really use 'income_type' column, i guess it can affect my conclusion. As for the numbers I got - I think it is pretty obvious that people without children have better chance to repay the loan on time, same with high income. "
